## Hi there! 👋

I am a **Computer Science graduate from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)**, passionate about working on projects related to **Generative AI** and **Natural Language Processing**. I am especially interested in exploring the **intersection of AI and Public Policy**, aiming to contribute to responsible and impactful AI solutions.  

Currently, I am enrolled in the **Oxford Machine Learning Summer School**, expanding my knowledge on use cases of Generative AI by attending lectures from leading industry researchers.  

- 🔭 I’ve completed my Final Year Design Project: Tracefy — an AI-powered system for generating realistic criminal sketches from sketches + descriptive prompts.   
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on AI for social good, open-source AI tools and tech-for-policy initiatives.

## 🚀 Key Projects  

Listed below are some of the projects I have completed during my studies. You can view the repository of each project for a deeper understanding of the workflow and implementation details.

- 🔎 **Tracefy**:  
  An AI-powered application that converts input line art to refined sketches using CycleGAN and generates photorealistic faces with ControlNet-guided FLUX.1-dev diffusion models conditioned on text prompts and refined sketches.

- ✍️ **Writing Style Analysis Task**:  
  RoBERTa fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to detect change in writing style at the paragraph level; achieved an F1 score of 0.80.

- 🌱 **LandUseAI Advisor**:  
  A Gemini-powered chatbot that delivers personalized land-use recommendations using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

- 🏨 **Hotel Recommendation System**:  
  A content-based recommendation model that utilizes TF-IDF scores to extract top tags for hotels from the Hotel Reviews Dataset.

- 🎵 **Spotify Features**:  
  Implemented core Spotify features in C++ using hash tables, binary search trees, and heap data structures for song search, popularity analysis, genre grouping, and artist word-search grid.
