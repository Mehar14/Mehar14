## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Computer Science graduate from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)**, passionate about working on projects related to **Generative AI** and **Natural Language Processing**. I am especially interested in exploring the **intersection of AI and Public Policy**, aiming to contribute to responsible and impactful AI solutions.  

Currently, I am enrolled in the **Oxford Machine Learning Summer School**, expanding my knowledge on use cases of Generative AI by attending lectures from leading industry researchers.
