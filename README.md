## Hi there! 👋

I am a **Computer Science graduate from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)**, passionate about working on projects related to **Generative AI** and **Natural Language Processing**. I am especially interested in exploring the **intersection of AI and Public Policy**, aiming to contribute to responsible and impactful AI solutions.  

Currently, I am enrolled in the **Oxford Machine Learning Summer School**, expanding my knowledge on use cases of Generative AI by attending lectures from leading industry researchers.  

- 🔭 I’ve completed my Final Year Design Project: Tracefy — an AI-powered system for generating realistic criminal sketches from sketches + descriptive prompts.   
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on: AI for social good, open-source AI tools, tech-for-policy initiatives.

 ## 🚀 Key Projects
Listed below are some of the projects I have completed during my studies. You can view the repository of each project for a deeper understanding of the workflow and implementation details.
-Tracefy: An AI-powered application that converts input line art to refined sketch using Cycle GAN and generates photorealistic faces with ControlNet-guided
FLUX.1-dev diffusion models conditioned on text prompt and refined sketch.
- Writing Style Analysis Task: RoBERTa fine-tuned with Low Rank Adaptation to detect change in writing style at paragraph level achieved an F1 Score of 0.80.
-LandUseAI Advisor: A Gemini-powered chatbot that delivers personalized land-use recommendations using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.
-Hotel Recommendation System: A content-based recommendation system model that utilizes TF-IDF scores to extract top tags for hotels from the Hotel Reviews Dataset.
-Spotify Features: Implemented Spotify features in C++ using hash tables, binary search trees and heap data structure for song search, popularity analysis, genre grouping and artist word-search grid.
